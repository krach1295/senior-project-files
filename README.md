# senior-project-files
The existing code for a game completed in one semester - this repository only contains the C# files I personally wrote.

These files aren't enough to actually run the game, but github's file size limit prevents me from putting the full zip file up,
since the environment files are very large.
If you'd like to see the full project, email me at krach1295@gmail.com and I'll send it to you.
